Caution is advised for activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving, due to reported occurrences of somnolence. The drug has demonstrated safety in pediatric patients aged 6 months to 11 years, with effectiveness extrapolated from adult studies for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria.', 'The most common adverse reaction in patients aged 12 years and older that occurred more\r\nfrequently on ZYRTEC than placebo was somnolence. The incidence of somnolence associated\r\nwith ZYRTEC was dose related, 6% in placebo, 11% at 5 mg and 14% at 10 mg.\r\nDiscontinuations due to somnolence for ZYRTEC were uncommon (1.0% on ZYRTEC vs. 0.6%\r\non placebo). Fatigue and dry mouth also appeared to be treatment-related adverse reactions.\r\nThere were no differences by age, race, gender or by body weight with regard to the incidence of\r\nadverse reactions.', 'Additive CNS depression when administered concomitantly with other CNS depressants.', 'null', 'Antihistamine', 'Non-RX', 10, 'True', 'Branded');
